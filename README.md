# P5js Platform Game
This platform game is a simple state system originally written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org) and ported to [P5js](http://p5js.org/).

The code was developed in stages to learn the foundation process of writing a platform style game in Processing. The first stages introduced movement, friction, bouncing, and gravity. Then jumping required the development of collision detection. This game uses a simple rectangle style intersection method for collision detection. With the minimal number of objects in the game, it is fast and simple. Enemies and images round out the game.

Sound in Processing uses the Minim sound library. Migrating to P5js uses the P5 sound library. Sound effects were created using the online sound generator [bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/)
